# Executive summary:
For this network the customer needed a nearly complete ground up design of their network. This network contains new equipment (PC, Laptops, Infrastructure, and security devices) along with a host of software (Email, Storage, Network Monitoring, and security). The customer needs these basic services to be as reliable and functional as possible. We will be providing a cloud based work environment centered around Microsoft Azure, this will provide AD, Storage, backups, email, notifications, and parts of security. Along with this cloud infrastructure we will be providing a Full unified wired and wireless network to both buildings.

# Introduction:

# Requirements Analysis:
## General Requirements -     
This building had only a small network in acounting. The buisness needed to have Computers for employees and secure storage and trasfer of confidential records. They are a government buisness and need their data to be secure but they also needed to be able to share between certaint departments and better analize data. 
<br>
<br>

## Hardware Requirements -     
The company needed an entire network from scratch. They needed a desktop computer per employee as well as a laptop per employee. There were also 54 micro computers to put in classroom labs. Each desktop and micro computer needed a monitor and periferals. We needed to design a network and purchase the hardware to put it in place so we had to buy switches, a support server, and access points to implement the network that they wanted. We planned all of the cat6 cable runs throughout the building as well as the fiber lines connecting our layer 3 switches and the fiber connection under the road to the other building. They wanted a lot of office printers and a larger printer/scanner/coppier, in order to better fit in the buget not everyone could get individual printers but the people we didn't give a printer to are in extream close proximity to the large comunal printer. We mapped where there should be power drops, each power drop would have 4 connections and each internet drop would have 2 connections. 
<br>
<br>

## Software Requirements -     
Since it is a government organization they needed a secure network and a secure storage. the AZURE suite had all of the components needed to build a network that was secure and accessable. We have secure storage set up and backed up with a seperate storage for accounting for added security. AZURE also has active directory so our network has security that insures only people who are allowed to look at or edit something are allowed to view it. We also have office 365 for each person so that they have access to word prossesing, spreadsheet, and presentation software to aid in the recording of information, the analizing of data, and the formation of presentations.
